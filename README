Installation:
	standard...
	 ./configure && make install

Deinstallation:
	Keep a copy around, cd into the glpong directory, run "make deinstall"

Playing the game:
	The object is to get the ball past the machine without letting it get
	the ball past you. Ping pong... :) The near paddle is you, the far one
	is the machine.

	Controls:
		The left arrow key moves your paddle to the left
		The right arrow key moves your paddle to the right (surprised?)
		The escape key exits the program
		F10 captures a screenshot and saves it as screenshot.bmp

	Command line arguments:
		If there are any arguments at all, it goes fullscreen.

	Email erik@elfga.com and stick 'glpong' in the subject.
